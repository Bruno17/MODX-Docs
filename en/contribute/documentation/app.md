title: 'Build the DocsApp'
---

[DocsApp](https://github.com/modxorg/DocsApp) is the application that serves up this documentation. It's custom-built in PHP using the Slim Framework, with a local SQLite database to index the search, translations and contributors. It's also open source, and contributions are more than welcome! :)

If you'd like to improve the documentation site (rather than the content), [start by reading the DocsApp Readme](https://github.com/modxorg/DocsApp/#docsapp-for-modx).

The documentation at docs.modx.com is hosted on a MODX-sponsored server. The mirror at docs.modx.org is hosted on a modmore-sponsored server and occasionally used as a staging environment for new features or improvements.
