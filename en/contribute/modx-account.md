You'll need an account on [MODX.com](https://modx.com) to manage your extras, discuss ideas or problems on [the community forum](http://community.modx.com), or to [sign the contributors license agreement](https://modx.com/community/cla/).

[Create a MODX account here](https://modx.com/login/create-account).

Everything else (contributing to [code](contribute/code), [issues](contribute/issues), or the [documentation](contribute/documentation)), typically requires a GitHub account.
