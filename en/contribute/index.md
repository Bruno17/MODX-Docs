Contributing to the MODX project is a noble pursuit in which you can help make things better for everyone. It's often a labor of love, and all the help is welcome. 

## What can you do?

[Developing the core code](contribute/code) is just one type of contribution. If you're not a developer, not all is lost however. There are other types of work that go into an open source project like MODX, and there's certainly something that fits your skills and interests. 

Besides developing fixes or features:

- [Testing pull requests](contribute/code/testing-pull-requests) is a great way to help, as your feedback on proposals can have a direct impact on whether something gets included in the core or not.
- [Reporting or triaging issues](contribute/issues) requires barely any code at all. Just use the product, report bugs, or try to reproduce reported issues to offer more information.
- [MODX can also be translated](contribute/translate) into dozens of languages. 
- [Writing and improving the documentation](contribute/documentation) lets you change this very page and help new (and seasoned) users understand how to best use MODX.
