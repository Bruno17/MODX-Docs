## Creating a Blog

Creating a Blog is simple: just right-click on any node in the Resources tree on the left-hand side, and mouse over to the "Create" option. Then click on "Create Articles Here":

This will load a screen to create a Articles Container - which is basically a blog - that can contain any number of articles (blog posts) you want.

### The First Tab

From there, you'll see a new editing screen that looks like this:

![](articles-tab1.png)

There are a few fields on the first tab that you can set:

1. **Container Title** - Sets the title of your container, or your blog.
2. **Container Alias** - This is the friendly URL name of the container. If you have this container in the site root, and set the alias to "blog", it would render as www.mysite.com/blog/
3. **Description** - A short description of your blog.
4. **Menu Title** - The title of your blog when it is being listed in a menu. This will default to the pagetitle if it's not set.
5. **Link Attributes** - Any HTML link attributes to show in the menu link when the blog is displayed in a menu.
6. **Hide from Menus** - If checked, your blog won't show up in any menus on your site.
7. **Published** - When checked, your blog is published and live!

Go ahead and give your Articles Container a title called "My Blog", and an alias of "blog". Then click on the "Template" tab.

### The Template Tab

The Template tab consists of templating options for your blog, such as selecting the Template to use, and other listing options.

![](articles-tab2.png)

The fields for this tab are:

1. **Uses Template** - The [Template](making-sites-with-modx/structuring-your-site/templates "Templates") for your Blog. Articles provides a sample Template, but if you want to change this, you can.
2. **Content** - The "content" of the blog - here you can rearrange how the `[[*content]]` field will render in your Articles Container Template.
3. **Article Template** - The default Template to select for your Articles (this can be overridden per article).
4. **Article Row Chunk** - The Chunk to use when displaying posts on the front page or archive pages. This will default to a sample provided Chunk.
5. **Articles Per Page** - The number of posts to show when listing posts on your blog. This will default to 10.

For now, you can keep the "Template" field selected to "sample.ArticlesContainerTemplate", and the "sample.ArticleTemplate" field selected to "sample.ArticleTemplate".

If you want to change the content of either of those Templates, it's **highly** recommended that you duplicate and rename them first. Any changes to the "sample" Templates will be overwritten if you upgrade Articles.

Note the "Content" field. Currently, it looks like this:

``` php
[[+articles]]

[[+paging]]
```

You can change this to restructure the positioning and markup of the posts as related to the pagination for the posts. You can also insert HTML markup here, and MODX tags.

Go ahead and click on the "Advanced Settings" tab.

### The Advanced Settings Tab

Again, if you plan to change any of the Chunks here, remember to duplicate them or select a different Chunk, rather than editing the "sample" ones, as they will be overwritten during upgrades.

See the the page on [Theming Articles](extras/articles/theming-articles "Articles.Theming Articles") for how to display other information inside your templates.
