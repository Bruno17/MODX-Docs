## What is renderResources

A general purpose snippet for rendering the output of a collection of Resources.

## Requirements

- MODX Revolution 2.1.0 or later
- PHP 5.1.2 or later

## History

renderResources was first written by Jason Coward (opengeek) and released on March 19th, 2012. [Development and bug reports are on Github](https://github.com/opengeek/renderResources).

### Download

It can be downloaded from within the MODX Revolution manager via [Package Management](developing-in-modx/advanced-development/package-management "Package Management"), or from the MODX Extras Repository, here: <https://modx.com/extras/package/renderresources>

It is NOT a replacement for Ditto, but rather an alternative component that can accomplish some of the things that the more specialized components do, i.e. Ditto, Wayfinder, Breadcrumbs; basically anything that output the properties for a list of Resources (formerly Documents in MODX Evolution).

## Usage

The renderResources snippet can be called using the tag:

``` php
[[renderResources]]
```

Calls without a &tpl property specified simply return the output from each Resource.

renderResources cannot be used with binary Content Types, or with modSymLink or modWebLink Resources. These Resources will be excluded from the selection criteria automatically.

#### tvFilters

Can be used to filter resources by certain TV values. These are entered as \[(_tvname_)(_operator_)\](_value_). There are two delimiters you can use to combine filter conditions.

You can have "OR" filters using two pipe symbols. An OR filter fetches resources that has one of the listed TV values.

``` php
mytv==somevalue||mytv==othervalue
```

You can also use an "and" filter using a comma. This will make sure that all the conditions are met.

``` php
mytv==somevalue,othertv==othervalue
```

For advanced filtering you can also group these. It is important to know that conditions are first seperated based on the OR (||) delimiter, and after that on the AND (,) delimiter. So let's take this hypothetical example:

``` php
mytv==foo||mytv==bar,bartv==3||bartv==1
```

This will filter resources to meet one of the following conditions:

- mytv is LIKE foo, or:
- mytv is LIKE bar AND bartv is LIKE 3, or:
- bartv is LIKE 1
  The examples above search for exact values. If you want, you can also use the percentage sign (%) as a wildcard. For example:

``` php
mytv==%a%
```

Matches any resources that has an "a" in the mytv value.

``` php
mytv==a%
```

Matches any resources that have a mytv value that starts with an a, and anything after that.

``` php
mytv==%a
```

Matches any resources that have a mytv value that ends with an a, but can have anything in front of it.

Of course you can also combine this with the OR (||) and AND (,) delimiters explained above.

It is important to know that this function **looks at the raw value of a template variable** for a specific resource. This means that **the value has been explicitly set for the resource**, and that it has not been **processed by a template variable output type**. So if you have an "autotag" tv, this means the raw value is a comma delimited list, and it is not split up in tags like you see it in the manager.

**Available filter operators**:

There are a number of comparison operators for use when creating filter conditions. In addition, when using many of these operators, numeric comparison values are automatically CAST TV values to numeric before comparison. Here is a list of the valid operators:

| Filter Operator |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | SQL Operator |

| sortby          | [Any Resource Field](making-sites-with-modx/structuring-your-site/resources#Resources-ResourcesResourceFields) (excluding Template Variables) to sort by. Some common fields to sort on are publishedon, menuindex, pagetitle etc, but see the Resources documentation for all fields. Specify fields with the name only, not using the tag syntax. Note that when using fields like template, publishedby and the likes for sorting, it will be sorted on the raw values, so the template or user ID, and NOT their names. |              |

You can also sort randomly by specifying RAND(), like so:

``` php
&sortby=`RAND()`
```

This can also be a [JSON](http://json-schema.org/) array to sort on multiple fields, e.g.

``` php
&sortby=`{"publishedon":"ASC","createdon":"DESC"}`
```

If you want to to sort in a specific order, you can do so by specifying a resource id-list like this:

``` php
&sortby=`FIELD(modResource.id, 4,7,2,5,1 )`
```

The same thing is possible if you put the sorted IDs in a template variable, like this:

``` php
&sortby=`FIELD(modResource.id,[[*templateVariable]])`
```

## Examples

Output a list of child Resources of the current Resource, using the 'myRowTpl' chunk:

``` php
[[!renderResources?
    &parents=`[[*id]]`
    &tpl=`myRowTpl`
]]
```

Output all resources beneath the Resource with ID '5', with the exception of resource 10, using the 'myRowTpl' chunk:

``` php
[[!renderResources?
    &parents=`5`
    &resources=`-10`
    &tpl=`myRowTpl`
]]
```

Output only the resources specified, using the 'myRowTpl' chunk:

``` php
[[!renderResources?
    &parents=`-1`
    &resources=`10,11,12`
    &tpl=`myRowTpl`
]]
```

Output the top 5 latest published Resources beneath the Resource with ID '5', with tpl 'blogPost':

``` php
[[!renderResources?
    &parents=`5`
    &limit=`5`
    &tpl=`blogPost`
    &includeContent=`1`
]]
```

Output a list of child Resources of the current Resource, based on the Resource-template:

``` php
[[!renderResources?
    &parents=`[[*id]]`
    &where=`{"template:=":8}`
    &tpl=`myRowTpl`
]]
```

Output a list of child Resources of the current Resource, where the Resource-template ID is 1 or 2:

``` php
[[!renderResources?
    &parents=`[[*id]]`
    &where=`{"template:=":1, "OR:template:=":2}`
    &tpl=`myRowTpl`
]]
```

Output a list of child Resources of the current Resource, where the Resource-template ID is 1, 2 or 3 (you cannot use the same key name more than once):

``` php
[[!renderResources?
    &parents=`[[*id]]`
    &where=`{"template:IN":[1,2,3]}`
    &tpl=`myRowTpl`
]]
```

Display a message when no results found (equivalent of "empty" parameter in Ditto):

``` php
[[!renderResources:default=`No results found`?
    &parents=`[[*id]]`
    &tpl=`myRowTpl`
]]
```

## Using getPage for Pagination

When combined with [getPage](extras/getpage "getPage"), renderResources allows you to do powerful and flexible pagination on your pages.

### Examples

Grab first 10 Resources - sorted by publishedon - below the Resource ID 17, no more than 2 levels deep, with the tpl 'blogListPost', including the TVs and content:

``` php
[[!getPage?
   &elementClass=`modSnippet`
   &element=`renderResources`

   &parents=`17`
   &depth=`2`
   &limit=`10`
   &pageVarKey=`page`

   &tpl=`blogListPost`
]]
<div class="paging">
<ul class="pageList">
  [[!+page.nav]]
</ul>
</div>
```

and the chunk blogListPost:

``` php
<div class="blogPost">
  [[+output]]
  <div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<hr/>
```

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing comes up!** Just to be sure, is **renderResources** installed?

## See Also

If you want to render properties of Resources rather than the complete output, use [getResources](extras/getresources "getResources").
If you only need to get a single field from a foreign resource, try using [getResourceField](extras/getresourcefield "getResourceField").
