## Quick guide for adding templates

Sometimes you have a piece of code that users sometimes need to add and you want the outcome to be the same everytime.
You can with Templates in TinyMCE.

This is just a quick guide for adding templates to TinyMCE in Revolution (I found this in the forums after searching for an hour, so I thought it might be worth putting it here).

\- In the manager, goto: **System -> System settings**.

\- Choose '**TinyMCE**' in the 'core' selection box and '**General**' in the 'filter-by-area' selection box.

\- Look for the property: '**Custom Plugins**' (key: 'tiny.custom_plugins'). Add the value '**template**' at the end of the list that is already there.

\- Change the value for the property '**Template List**' (key: `tiny.template_list`). Add the values (templates) in a comma separated list in this format:

```php
name:path-to-the-template:description
```

Note the semicolon as separators for the three necessary fields for one template. Add more by adding a comma followed by the next list.

Apparently you can use a snippet that contains the list, but I couldn't get it to work.

\- Add the value '**template**' to one of the button lists (select '**Custom buttons**' in the 'Filter-by-area' selection box).

Don't forget to upload the template-code in the path you just entered.
