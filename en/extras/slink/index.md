### &title and &link usage

The `&title` and `&link` can be set to different values. They determine the text to use for the `title` attribute and the link text respectively.

When `&to` is a resource, you can use resource fields, like: `pagetitle`, `menutitle`, `longtitle`, `introtext`, or `description`

You can also set it to a regular string text.

## Examples

Minimum call which gets the menutitle of resource 5 for the link text, and the longtitle for the title (hover) text.

``` php
[[sLink? &to=`5`]]
```

Minimum call for external links, with link and title text set in the snippet call.

``` php
[[sLink? &to=`https://rtfm.modx.com` &title=`Please, read that manual!` &link=`RTFM`]]
```

Calling sLink to create an anchor within your page.

``` php
[[sLink? &to=`#myAnchor` &name=`myAnchor` &link=`This is an anchor` &title=`Clicking me focuses your screen`]]
```
