Integration of any service is very simple. So, you can read about [Facebook](extras/hybridauth/hybridauth.integrating-google), first, then look to screenshots and everything must be clear.

#### Registering application

**1**. Go to <http://vk.com/editapp?act=create>

**2**. Choose **"Website"** and fill Site address and Base domain.

**3**. For your MODX System Setting **ha.keys.Vkontakte** (you may need to create it) the value will be

``` php
{"id":"Application ID","secret":"Secure key"}
```
