**Javascript Free!**
This plugin does not require, create, or utilize unnecessary Javascript, thereby reducing the overhead on the web browser client.

## What it does

This MODX Revolution Plugin operates transparently in the background diligently obfuscating all e-mail addresses it finds - whether they appear as links or as straight text in the given page. It can find all common email addresses as specified by RFC2822, including all unusual but allowed characters.

## How it works

It turns shawn@shawnwilkerson.com into:

``` php
s&#x68;&#97;wn&#64;&#x73;&#x68;&#97;&#119;&#x6e;&#x77;&#105;&#x6c;&#107;&#x65;&#x72;&#115;&#111;&#110;.&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;
```

## Who it works for

All users on the project, links to outside e-mail addresses, same-site e-mail address, etc.
It simply works on _all_ e-mail addresses.

## Additional Functionality

While the plug-in is operating transparently in the back ground, it is also performing another task. It is constantly randomizing the encoding of the e-mail address, as to make it appear it is always change, though they work flawlessly in e-mail applications and simply cut and paste operations.

## Examples

This adds an additional layer of protection.The following three are all the same e-mail address from the same page:

``` php
&#115;&#104;&#97;&#119;&#110;&#64;&#x73;&#x68;&#x61;&#x77;&#x6e;&#119;&#105;&#x6c;&#107;&#x65;r&#x73;&#111;&#110;.&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;
```

``` php
s&#x68;&#97;wn&#64;&#x73;&#x68;&#97;&#119;&#x6e;&#x77;&#105;&#x6c;&#107;&#x65;&#x72;&#115;&#111;&#110;.&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;
```

``` php
&#x73;&#x68;&#97;&#x77;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x73;&#104;&#97;&#119;&#x6e;&#119;&#x69;&#x6c;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#x73;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x2e;c&#x6f;&#x6d;
```

## History

This Plugin was originally released for MODX Evolution by Aloysius Lim: <https://modx.com/extras/package/obfuscateemail>. When I made the jump to MODX Revolution a few years ago, I brought this plugin along as it had served my clients well. With the Release of MODX Revolution 2.1 and its move away from legacy code, some updates had to be performed.
I hope you find ObfuscateEmail-Revo as effective as I have over the years.
