## What is HitsPage?

HitsPage is a Plugin that counts the number of http requests, or "hits" on a given web page.

## Requirements

MODX Revolution 2.1.x or later

## History

HitsPage was written by Valentine Rasulov and released October 27th, 2011

### Download

It can be downloaded from within the MODX Revolution manager via [Package Management](developing-in-modx/advanced-development/package-management "Package Management"), or from the MODX Extras Repository, here:

<https://modx.com/extras/package/hitspage>

## Usage

Upon installation, HitsPage creates two new [Template Variables](making-sites-with-modx/customizing-content/template-variables "Template Variables"), "HitsPage" and "hits". At the time of this writing, the "hits" TV is redundant.

On the [Resource](building-sites/resources "Resource") that you'd like to track hits, use the placeholder:

``` php
[[!+hitss]]
```

You can put this in the Resource Content Field, or in its [Template](making-sites-with-modx/structuring-your-site/templates "Templates"), but it MUST be present on the page you wish to track. You can hide its display using CSS, if you wish.

**Idiosyncratic Behaviour**
Do NOT use the TV tag to render output on the page. It seems to break the plugin. Only use it in &tpl chunks (see below).

Once the placeholder is...in place, the "HitsPage" TV will be dynamically updated with the hit count, making it available to [Snippets](developing-in-modx/basic-development/snippets "Snippets") via their Tpl [Chunks](making-sites-with-modx/structuring-your-site/chunks "Chunks").

## Examples

A [getResources](extras/getresources "getResources") call using the following &tpl will return a list of pages displaying their Titles and the number of hits they've received:

``` php
<li>[[+pagetitle]] has been viewed [[+tv.HitsPage]] times.</li>
```

**Usage Example**
You can easily create a "Most Popular Posts" widget by following the tutorial here: <http://www.sepiariver.ca/blog/modx-web/modx-popular-posts-plugin-hit-counter-getresources>
