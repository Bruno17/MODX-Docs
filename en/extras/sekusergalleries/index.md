## Usage

The sekUserGalleries is called through several snippets using the below tags ?(currently all snippets should be called on separate pages):

- [sekUserGalleries.browse.galleries](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.browse.galleries "sekUserGalleries.browse.galleries") - This will display all the galleries.
- [sekUserGalleries.users.gallery.view](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.users.gallery.view "sekUserGalleries.users.gallery.view") - Display the selected galleries albums. If no gallery is specified in the url, and the user is logged in and has permission to have a gallery, this will default to that user's gallery page.
- [sekUserGalleries.users.gallery.manage](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.users.gallery.manage "sekUserGalleries.users.gallery.manage") - This page will allow the user to change their user settings for the gallery, if they are logged in and have permission.
- [sekUserGalleries.album.view](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.album.view "sekUserGalleries.album.view") - View the images within the selected album.
- [sekUserGalleries.album.manage](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.album.manage "sekUserGalleries.album.manage") - Add, edit, and remove albums to the gallery, if the user is logged in and has permission.
- [sekUserGalleries.album.items.manage](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.album.items.manage "sekUserGalleries.album.items.manage") - Add, edit, and remove the album items. Currently set up to upload images only.
- [sekUserGalleries.album.items.helper](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.album.items.helper "sekUserGalleries.album.items.helper") - This helper snippet does all the work for the `[[album.items.manage]]` snippet.
- [sekUserGalleries.image.information](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.image.information "sekUserGalleries.image.information") - Simple snippet that gives additional information about an image, like the date the picture was taken, camera used, etc.
- [sekUserGalleries.search](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.search "sekUserGalleries.search") - Search the albums title, description, and keywords, and display.
- [sekUserGalleries.directory](extras/sekusergalleries/sekusergalleries.directory "sekUserGalleries.directory") - Display how much space the user is currently using on the server (This uses the 1024 based measurement, MiB, GiB, etc).

Ensure that the page resource id for each snippet is entered into the Settings (see below Available Settings) to ensure the pages work correctly.

## The Manager

### Group Settings

The group settings uses modx's user group's and role's to manage the permissions for using the gallery. By default, anyone can view the galleries, but only a user with matching user group and role defined in the Group Settings can create, edit, or delete images and albums. To learn more about how Modx manages user groups view the [User Groups](building-sites/client-proofing/security/user-groups) section.
