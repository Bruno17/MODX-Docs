## getArchives Snippet

This snippet displays the results from an archive link generated by the [Archivist](extras/archivist/archivist "Archivist") snippet.

## Usage

Simply place the snippet wherever you would like to display archives. getArchives will automatically handle the FURLs and input from the [Archivist](extras/archivist/archivist "Archivist") snippet call.

``` php
[[!getArchives? &parents=`4,12,33`]]
```

If using with [getPage](extras/getpage "getPage"), make sure to set &cache=`0` on the getPage call.

## Available Properties

getArchives is a variant of [getResources](extras/getresources "getResources"), **so all the properties in** **[getResources](extras/getresources "getResources")** **are also available to getArchives**, as well as the following:

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| tpl           | Name of a chunk serving as a resource template.                                                                                                          |             |
| parents       | Comma-delimited list of ids serving as parents.                                                                                                          |             |
| filterField   | The field to use to filter by when filtering by archives. Make sure this is the same as the sortBy parameter on the Archivist snippet call.              | publishedon |
| filterPrefix  | The prefix to use for GET parameters with the Archivist links. Make sure this is the same as the filterPrefix parameter on the getArchives snippet call. | arc\_       |
| tagsIndex     | If set, and a REQUEST var of this index is found, will automatically filter results by the value.                                                        | tags        |
| toPlaceholder | If set, will set the output of this snippet to this placeholder rather than output it.                                                                   |             |

If your getArchives call is not displaying any results and your resources are **hidden from menus**, make sure you specify the &showHidden=`1` parameter (inherited from getResource) parameter!

## getArchives Chunks

There is 1 chunk that is processed in getArchives. Its corresponding getArchives parameter is:

- [tpl](extras/archivist/archivist.getarchives/archivist.getarchives/tpl "tpl") - The Chunk to use for each result displayed.

## Examples

Display archives for parents 4, 12 and 33, and set the results to a placeholder called 'results':

``` php
[[!getArchives? &parents=`4,12,33` &toPlaceholder=`results`]]

<h2>Search Results</h2>

[[!+results]]
```
