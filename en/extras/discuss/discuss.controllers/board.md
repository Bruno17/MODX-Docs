| showSubBoards                    |                            | When set to true, subboards will be available in the "boards" placeholder. When no boards are available, the "boards" placeholder will be empty and "boards\_toggle" will have a value of "display: none;", which can be used to hide outer wrappers for subboards.                                                                                                  |

Setting discuss.show\_whos\_online needs to be enabled. Text is built up from the users' username, wrapped in an `<a>` tag if the user has access to view profiles, with multiple people viewing joined together with a comma. |
| showModerators                   |                            | When set to true, the moderators for the current board will be available in the "moderators" placeholder. The text in here will be built up from the users display or username, wrapped in an `<a>` tag if the viewer has access to view profiles, with multiple moderators joined together with a comma.                                                            |
| showPaginationIfOnePage          |                            | If there is only one page of threads, this switch decides if there should be a pagination available in the "pagination" placeholder or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## System Events

### OnDiscussRenderBoard

All currently set placeholders are available through the $placeholders array. The return value or $modx->event->output() value is expected to be an array of placeholders to override. Using a plugin on this event is the only way to put a value in the top, bottom, aboveThreads, belowThreads, aboveBoards and belowBoards placeholders.
