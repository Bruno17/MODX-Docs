## What is Discuss?

Discuss is a native forum solution for MODX Revolution.

After a long time of internal usage only, Discuss 1.1.0 was released on Christmas Eve 2012. While it's a pl, this version should be treated as a beta launch as we expect bugs and issues now that more people start playing around with it. As forums.modx.com obviously runs Discuss, it is considered stable enough to run a forum with 400K posts but will need more testing and contributors to get it to be the #1 forum addon ever.

### Requirements

- MODX Revolution, at least 2.2 and latest suggested.
- PHP5 or later

### History

Discuss was originally written by [Shaun McCormick](https://github.com/splittingred) as a native forum solution, and first released on March 22nd, 2010. It was removed several months later due to the inability to continue core development on it. Late 2012, it was picked up again with development by other core team members including Mark Hamstra, Mike Schell and Dustin Walker with a renewed release (1.1.0) on Christmas Eve 2012.
