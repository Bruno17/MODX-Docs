## What is CustomUrls?

This extra allows you to define custom alias or URI patterns for your resources. **It supports translit and Redirector packages**.

You can build your patterns from resource fields, TV, snippets and output filters and set some constraints like you'd do with custom forms.

For example, with CustomURLs you can add the resource's ID or publish month in the aliases of all resources or just for ones whose parent = 1 or template = 1.

## Pattern examples

Simple text :

``` php
simple-text
```

Default MODx alias :

``` php
[[+alias]]
```

Resource placeholders :

``` php
[[+id]]-[[+alias]]
```

TVs :

``` php
[[+tv.mytv]]-[[+id]]
```

Snippets :

``` php
[[MySnippet? &id=`[[+id]]`]]
```

Output filters :

``` php
[[+publishedon:strtotime:date=`%Y-%m-%d`]]/[[+id]]-[[+alias]]
```

Default MODx URI :

``` php
[[+cu.parent_uri]]/[[+alias]]
```

More complex URI

``` php
[[+cu.parent_uri]]/some-text/[[getResourceField? &id=`[[+parent]]`]]/[[+id]]-[[+alias]]
```
