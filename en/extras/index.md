In this section of the documentation you'll find information about extras for MODX Revolution. These extras (and their documentation) are made by third party developers, so are not officially supported.

## Where to find Extras

The official source of extras is **MODX.com**. You can [browse hundreds of (free) extras](https://modx.com/extras/) and every installation of MODX is already configured to [download and install extras from MODX.com through the package manager](building-sites/extras).

There are also third-party sources and marketplaces available, which typically offer a combination of free and premium extras. These include:

## Distributing your own Extras

Go to <https://modx.com/extras/>, log in to your MODX account (or create one), then click on the button at the bottom to "Submit an Extra".

There you can upload a MODX [Transport Package](extending-modx/transport-packages "Transport Packages"). This is a special kind of zip file that ensures that your add-on and all of its components are installed correctly on the target system. To make one, you need to create a [Build Script](extending-modx/transport-packages/build-script "Creating a 3rd Party Component Build Script").

All extras hosted on MODX.com go through a basic review; it may take a couple of days for your submission to be processed.
