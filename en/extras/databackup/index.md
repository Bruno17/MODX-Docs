## What is Databackup?

Databackup is a [Snippet](developing-in-modx/basic-development/snippets "Snippets") for MODX Revolution that will backup your MODX MySQL database as one sql dump file and/or each table as a SQL dump as well as other MySQL databases. The extra does use PDO so it might be able to do other databases, like MSSQL, as is but I have not tested this.

## History

Databackup was written by Josh Gulledge as an easy way to keep data backups, and first released on August 12th, 2011.

### Download

It can be downloaded from within the MODX Revolution manager via [Package Management](developing-in-modx/advanced-development/package-management "Package Management"), or from the MODx Extras Repository, here: <https://modx.com/extras/package/databackup>

### Development and Bug Reporting

Databackup is stored and developed in GitHub, and can be found here:<https://github.com/jgulledge19/DataBackup>

Bugs can be filed here: <https://github.com/jgulledge19/DataBackup/issues>

## How to Use

1. Install via the package manager
2. Set the databackup.folder setting to something that is above your web root. The default is core/components/databackup/dumps/
3. Set the purge time option (databackup.pruge) if you want this to be different, the default is 1814400, which is 21 days.
4. Set up Cron Manager: [display/ADDON/CronManager](extras/cronmanager) and then Create a new job.
5. Select the backup snippet and then select in minutes how often you would like this to run. Every 24 hours is 1440 minutes.

### How to use snippet with getCache

See: [getcache](http://www.jasoncoward.com/technology/2010/10/simple-content-caching-with-getcache.html) for getCache examples.

This is a simple backup your site every 24 hours(assuming the page is visited) or less if you flush the cache. It will also purge the backups older then 21 days.

``` php
[[!getCache?
&element=`backup`
&excludeTables=`my_custom_table,my_other_custom_table`
&cacheExpires=`86400`
]]
```

### [System Settings](building-sites/settings "System Settings")

These need to be created if they do not exist.

| Name        | Key               | Field Type | Namespace  | Description                                                                                               | Default Value                            |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Folder      | databackup.folder | Textfield  | databackup | This is the folder path that will save you .sql files to. PHP must have write permissions to this folder. | {core\_path}components/databackup/dumps/ |
| Purge Files | databackup.purge  | Textfield  | databackup | Purge old files that are older then the current time - seconds. Default is 1814400 (21 days).             | 1814400                                  |

#### WARNING

Be careful where you make the file path for the purge setting: databackup.folder. If you place this in an existing folder, all files older than the purge date will be delete. It is recommended that you create a new folder for your backups that is above your public WWW folder.

### Available Properties

There is also a sample backupMany snippet. You can modify this example snippet to backup other databases.
