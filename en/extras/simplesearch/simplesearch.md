| extractSource     | (new in version 1.9) Allows the user to define where the extract comes from. If the value of this parameter is a resource field name (including TVs if &includeTVs is set) then that resource field is used for the extract. Otherwise the parameter is taken as the name of a Snippet to run. The Snippet is passed the resource array as parameters. If there is no Snippet by that name, then the extract will be empty. | content                                                 |
| extractLength     | The number of characters for the content extraction of each search result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 200                                                     |
| extractEllipsis   | The string used to wrap extract results with.

| includeTVs        | Indicates if TemplateVar values should be included in the properties available to each resource template. Defaults to 0. Turning this on might make your search slower if you have lots of TVs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0                                                       |
| includeTVList     | An optional comma-delimited list of TemplateVar names to include explicitly if includeTVs is 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                         |
| process TVs       | Indicates if TemplateVar values should be rendered as they would on the resource being summarized. Defaults to 0. Some notes: <br>TVs can be accessed by their TV name `[[+myTV]]` By default SimpleSearch does not use a prefix, e.g. `[[+tv.myTV]]` will NOT render. TVs are processed during indexing for Solr searching, so there is no need to do this here.                                                           | 0                                                       |

## SimpleSearch Chunks

There are 4 chunks that are processed in SimpleSearch. Their corresponding SimpleSearch parameters are:

- [tpl](extras/simplesearch/simplesearch/tpl "SimpleSearch.SimpleSearch.tpl") - The Chunk to use for each result displayed.
- [containerTpl](extras/simplesearch/simplesearch/containertpl "SimpleSearch.SimpleSearch.containerTpl") - The Chunk that will be used to wrap all the search results, pagination and message.
- [pageTpl](extras/simplesearch/simplesearch/pagetpl "SimpleSearch.SimpleSearch.pageTpl") - The Chunk to use for a pagination link.
- [currentPageTpl](extras/simplesearch/simplesearch/currentpagetpl "SimpleSearch.SimpleSearch.currentPageTpl") - The Chunk to use for the current pagination link.

## Searching Custom Tables

Searching custom tables is available in SimpleSearch using the &customPackages property; however, you must have a custom package built for it. The format is:

``` php
className:fieldName(s):packageName:packagePath:joinCriteria||class2Name:fieldName(s):package2Name:package2Path:join2Criteria
```

In other words, each custom package is separated by ||. Then, each part of it is separated by colons (:). An example to search [Quip](extras/quip "Quip") comments:

``` php
&customPackages=`quipComment:body:quip:{core_path}components/quip/model/:quipComment.resource = modResource.id`
```

Let's break down each part:

- **className** - The class name of the table you want to search. Here, it's QuipComment.
- **fieldName(s)** - A comma-separated list of column names to search. We did 'body', you could also have done 'body,email' or whatever.
- **packageName** - The name of the schema Package to add. This one is called quip.
- **packagePath** - The path to the model/ directory where the package is located.
- **joinCriteria** - The SQL to join the table you want to search and the modResource table. Your table must have some connection to the Resource it's on (otherwise SimpleSearch won't know how to load a URL for it!)

Once you've added it, it will search those fields as well for data. If it finds it in that table, it will display the result as a link to the Resource you specified in your joinCriteria. In our example, that would be the resource the Quip comment is located on.

## Examples

These examples assume you've already sent the search query with the [SimpleSearchForm](extras/simplesearch/simplesearch.simplesearchform "SimpleSearch.SimpleSearchForm") snippet.

Display results, but just show their titles:

``` php
[[!SimpleSearch? &showExtract=`0`]]
```

Display all results but only in Resources 1, 3, or 4 - or below those Resources - and highlight tags with a 'strong' tag:

``` php
[[!SimpleSearch? &ids=`1,3,4` &highlightTag=`strong`]]
```

Only find search results that use all the words in the query string, and set the results to the placeholder 'results':

``` php
[[!SimpleSearch? &useAllWords=`1` &toPlaceholder=`results`]]
```
