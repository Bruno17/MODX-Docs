## Usage

getFeed is used by placing the Snippet call into your content and passing a 'url' parameter:

[[!getFeed? &url=`http://path.com/to/my/rss.feed.rss`]]
```

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| url           | URL of the feed to retrieve.                                                                                |         |
| tpl           | Name of a chunk to serve as an item tpl. If blank, will output the placeholders as arrays.                  |         |
| limit         | Limit the number of items to return; 0 is no limit.                                                         | 0       |
| offset        | The zero-based index of the item to start at in the feed results.                                           | 0       |
| totalVar      | The name of a placeholder where the total number of items in the feed is stored. For getPage compatibility. | total   |
| toPlaceholder | If set, will set the output to this placeholder name. If not set, will output directly the results.         |         |

### Chunk Placeholders

Since different feeds return different placeholders, what is best to get the placeholders available is to pass getFeed without a 'tpl' parameter. This will then show you an array of fields and their values. Their 'indexes', or the key of each array item, can be used in a placeholder.

Some common placeholders are:

- **title** - The title of the post.
- **link** - A direct link to the post.
- **description** - The description of the post.
- **pubdate** - The date the post was published.
- **guid** - The GUID of the post.
- **author** - The name of the author of the post.
- **category** - Any tags or category associations the post has.
- **summary** - A short summary of the post.
- **date\_timestamp** - The timestamp of the post.
