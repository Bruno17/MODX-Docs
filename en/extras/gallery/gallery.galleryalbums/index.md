## GalleryAlbums Snippet

This snippet displays a list of Albums. It by default only grabs "prominent" albums.

You can display a thumbnail for each album of an image in the album by setting the "rowTpl" property to "galAlbumRowWithCoverTpl", or using `[[+image]]` in your custom rowTpl.

- [containerTpl](extras/gallery/gallery.galleryalbums/containertpl) - The Chunk to use for wrapping all album rows (available with 1.6.0 beta).

## Examples

``` php
[[!GalleryAlbums]]
```

``` php
[[!GalleryAlbums?
    &sort=`name`
    &dir=`ASC`
]]
```

``` php
[[!GalleryAlbums?
    &limit=`3`
    &prominentOnly=`0`
    &toPlaceholder=`albums`
]]
```
