2. Copy & add /assets/components/calendar.js to your website template (only needed on pages where calendar will be used)
3. Copy & add /assets/components/jquery.calendar-widget.js to your website template (only needed on pages where calendar will be used)
4. Create a resource for the events calendar (or add it to your template(s))
5. Create a resource for the upcoming events list (see template example below)
6. Create a resource below that for a single event (see template example below)
7. Create a Context setting 'evxEventsPage' and set the 'upcoming events page' id as value
8. Create a Context setting 'evxEventPage' and set the 'single event page' id as value
