| maxCrumbs            | Max number of elements to have in a path. 100 is an arbitrary high number. If you make it smaller, like say 2, but you are 5 levels deep, it will appear as: Home > ... > Level 4 > Level 5 It should be noted that "Home" and the current page do not count. Each of these are configured separately.                                                                                                      | 100         |

| pathThruUnPub        | When your path includes an unpublished folder, setting this to true will show all resources in path EXCEPT the unpublished. Example path (unpublished in caps): home > news > CURRENT > SPORTS > skiiing > article $pathThruUnPub = true would give you this: home > news > skiiing > article $pathThruUnPub = false would give you this: home > skiiing > article (assuming you have home crumb turned on) | 1           |

| showCrumbsAtHome     | You can use this to toggle the breadcrumbs on the home page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 0           |

| showHomeCrumb        | Would you like your crumb string to start with a link to home? Some would not because a home link is usually found in the site logo or elsewhere in the navigation scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1           |
| titleField           | To change default page field to be used as a breadcrumb title. Defaults to pagetitle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | pagetitle   |

### Breadcrumbs Classes

The output is an unordered list with microdata (see <http://diveintohtml5.info/extensibility.html> for more information) that can be styled using the following class names.

| Classname       | Description                                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B\_crumbBox     | Span that surrounds all crumb output                                              |
| B\_hideCrumb    | Span surrounding the "..." if there are more crumbs than will be shown            |
| B\_currentCrumb | Span or A tag surrounding the current crumb                                       |
| B\_firstCrumb   | Span that always surrounds the first crumb, whether it is "home" or not           |
| B\_lastCrumb    | Span surrounding last crumb, whether it is the current page or not .              |
| B\_crumb        | Class given to each A tag surrounding the intermediate crumbs (not home, or hide) |
| B\_homeCrumb    | Class given to the home crumb                                                     |

## Examples

Show breadcrumbs with a pipeline | for a separator.

``` php
[[Breadcrumbs? &crumbSeparator=`|`]]
```

In MODX Revolution 2.2, the &respectHidemenu property value must be given as `0` or `1` rather than `true` or `false`. I haven't tested this in other versions, but the 2.2 site I'm working on now would not adhere to the property's settings using `true` or `false`.
