## mhpaypal Snippet Usage

_This document provides information on the mhPayPal snippet, its properties and some example usages. If looking for more information about the mhPayPal package in which the snippet is included, please visit ?__[mhPayPal](extras/mhpaypal "mhPayPal")_ instead.

## Introduction

The mhPayPal snippet is the core of the mhPayPal package. It outputs your form, validates the input, sends the visitor to PayPal for immediate payment and processes any hooks you may have configured. There are basically two ways you can use this snippet. Either to accept donations where the user types in the amount they want to donate, or to accept one product payments based on a price you set in the snippet call.

Since the result of the mhPayPal snippet depends on the user, URL parameters etc, **the mhPayPal snippet always needs to be called uncached!**

## Snippet Properties

The list below is a list of all the properties you may use with mhPayPal. Please refer to the ?[Tag Syntax](making-sites-with-modx/tag-syntax "Tag Syntax") if you are unsure on how to use these properties.

## Example Usage

Please also see the specific pages for hooks and templating for more detail about those. Please note that this assumes a correct installation and configured PayPal API access.

### Minimum Snippet Call

Displays the default form with all default options, meaning it will allow users to fill in their desired donation with a minimum of 5 EUR/USD/GBP.

``` php
[[!mhPayPal]]
```

### Using mhPayPal to make a one-product fixed price payments

This example still uses the default form (you probably don't want that in this case), but ignores what the user choses and forces the USD currency at an amount of 15 bucks + 2.85 taxes. This also sets a description. This could be a great starting point, along with a custom chunk tpl and a hook or two, for allowing super quick check out of products.

``` php
[[!mhPayPal?
  &amount=`15`
  &amountTax=`2.85`
  &description=`Product XYZ ([[+currency]][[+amount]])`
  &currencies=`USD`
]]
```
