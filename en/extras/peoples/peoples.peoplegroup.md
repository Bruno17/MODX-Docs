## PeopleGroup Chunks

The only chunk used in the PeopleGroup snippet is the &userTpl property, which uses the default of pplGroupUser.

- [userTpl](extras/peoples/peoples.peoplegroup/peoples.peoplegroup.usertpl "Peoples.PeopleGroup.userTpl")

## Examples

Show all the Users of the User Group "Marketing", but sort by Role Authority instead of username:

``` php
[[!PeopleGroup?
  &usergroup=`Marketing`
  &placeholderPrefix=`ug.`
  &toPlaceholder=`ug.users`
  &sortBy=`authority`
  &sortByAlias=`UserGroupRole`
]]

<h2>Users in [[+ug.name]]</h2>

[[+ug.users]]
```
