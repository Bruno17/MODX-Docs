## About mxCalendar

mxCalendar is a extra created for both Evolution and Revolution to allow for full calendar editing using the native Manager of ModX. The calendar supports various views including calendar, list, and detail of which all views support the ModX template standards for fully customizing your themes. In addition mxCalendar supports feature rich calendar functions such as repeating events, Google Maps, cateogries, context, and unique calendars.

## Installation

### ModX Revolution

It can be downloaded from within the MODX Revolution manager via [Package Management](developing-in-modx/advanced-development/package-management "Package Management"), or from the MODX Extras Repository, here: <https://modx.com/extras/package/mxcalendar2>. When using the Package Management for direct download you can simply click on the "Install" button after download completes. If you choose to download from the extras site you will then need to FTP, or otherwise move, the transport package zip file to your "/core/packages/" folder first. After you have copied the transport zip file to your packages folder you will then need to launch Package Management from inside the Manager (ver 2.2.x) and then select the down arrow next to "Download Extras" and select the last option "Search Locally for Packages" and then find "mxcalendars" in the list of packages and choose "install".

## Creating New Events

In the manager menu, select **Components** -> **mxCalendar**. Select the **Events** tab, click **Create New Calendar Item**.

Select a context. Leave blank for all contexts. Give the event a name, select a calendar to associate the event with, a category, and start and end date/times.

Enter your event description in the rich text editor. This populates the `[[*content]]` for the event detail view.

In the Location tab, name the location and enter the address. Check "Display Map" to output a Google Map for the address that you entered.
The example shown is the default Google Map display in a styled modal window (tplDetail or tplDetailModal).

## Using mxCalendar

Now to the best part, using mxCalendar to manage and display events.

## Basic Use

After installation you should be able to call the default view (calendar) in your resource using:

``` php
[[!mxcalendar?]]
```

This should provide you with the calendar view and full page load on navigation. If you want to step things up a notch to use the AJAX navigation and modal view of event details we'd add two additional parameters to the snippet call. The first is the "ajaxResourceId" which should be a new resource (page) that is created using the (blank) template since we are returning this in the ajax response and simply modifying the DOM. The next thing we want to add is the "modalView" set to true to enable the modal display of the event details.

``` php
[[!mxcalendar?
&ajaxResourceId=`43`
&modalView=`1`
]]
```

Now when you reload your primary page with the mxcalendar snippet call, not the ajax one, you shoudl see the same display however now when you click on the arrows for previous and next months the content is loaded via ajax and not an entire URL page reload. The second thing you should notice is now when you click on and event title in the calendar view it displayes the event detail view in a nice modal window. ah... that's nice
