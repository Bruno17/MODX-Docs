**Name**: Send X-Powered-By Header  
**Type**: Yes/No  
**Default**: Yes  
**Available In**: Revolution 2.5.0+

When enabled, MODX will send the "X-Powered-By" header to identify this site as built on MODX. This helps tracking global MODX usage through third party trackers inspecting your site. Because this makes it easier to identify what your site is built with, it might pose a slightly increased security risk if a vulnerability is found in MODX.
