**Name**: Friendly URL Prefix
**Type**: String
**Default**:  
**Removed In**: Revolution 2.0.1

Here you can specify the prefix to use for friendly URLs. For example, a prefix setting of 'page' will turn the URL `/index.php?id=2` to the friendly URL `/page2.html` (assuming the suffix is set to '.html'). This way you can specify what your users (and search engines) see for links on your site.
