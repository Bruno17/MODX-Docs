**Name**: Use Strict Friendly URLs  
**Type**: Yes/No  
**Default**: No  
**Available In**: Revolution 2.2.3+

When friendly URLs are enabled, this option forces non-canonical requests that match a Resource to 301 redirect to the canonical URI for that Resource. 

**WARNING:** Do not enable if you use custom rewrite rules which do not match at least the beginning of the canonical URI. For example, a canonical URI of `foo/` with custom rewrites for `foo/bar.html` would work, but attempts to rewrite `bar/foo.html` as `foo/` would force a redirect to `foo/` with this option enabled
