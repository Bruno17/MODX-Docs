## xPDOObject::addMany()

Adds an object or collection of objects related to this class.

## Syntax

API Docs: [xPDOObject::addMany()](<http://api.modx.com/revolution/2.2/db_core_xpdo_om_xpdoobject.class.html#%5CxPDOObject::addMany()>)

```php
boolean addMany (
   mixed &$obj,
   [string $alias = '']
)
```

## Example

Add golf clubs to a bag and save.

```php
$bag = $xpdo->newObject('GolfBag');
$bag->set('name',"Chris's Bag");
$bag->set('color','blue');
$clubs = array();
for ($i=1;$i<10;$i++) {
   $club = $xpdo->newObject('GolfClub');
   $club->set('name',$i.' Iron');
   $clubs[] = $club;
}
$bag->addMany($clubs);
$bag->save(); // saves both the bag and all the clubs
```

**Nested Calls** You can nest one addMany() call inside another and thus create all your related data via a single save() operation.

## Troubleshooting

Remember that this operation is intended to be called only for objects whose relationships are defined as cardinality="many".
