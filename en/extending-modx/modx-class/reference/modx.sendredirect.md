## modX::sendRedirect

Sends a redirect to the specified URL using the specified method.

## Syntax

API Doc: [modX::sendRedirect()](http://api.modx.com/revolution/2.2/db_core_model_modx_modx.class.html#%5CmodX::sendRedirect())

``` php
void sendRedirect (string $url, [array $options = false], [string $type = ''], [string $responseCode])
```

Please note that the $type and $responseCode have been deprecated and will likely be removed in an upcoming release. **Do not rely on those**.

`$url` needs to be a proper url, which could be generated using `modX::makeUrl`, to redirect to.
`$options` accepts an array with one or more of the following key/value pairs:

- `type`, one of the following (`REDIRECT_HEADER` is the default):
    - `REDIRECT_REFRESH` - Uses the header refresh method
    - `REDIRECT_META` - Sends a a META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" tag to the output
    - `REDIRECT_HEADER` - Uses the header location method
- `responseCode` which needs to be the proper HTTP response, so not just "301" or "302". It defaults to HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily, but you could set it to "HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently" for a 301-style redirect.
- `count_attempts` indicates the number of attempts to redirect before halting.

`$type`, which is deprecated and should not be used, is the same as the type $options array key.
`$responseCode`, which is deprecated and should not be used, is the same as the responseCode $options array key.

## Examples

Send a redirection request to the Resource with ID 54.

``` php
$url = $modx->makeUrl(54);
$modx->sendRedirect($url);
```

Send a redirect to modx.com. Do so via the META HTTP-EQUIV refresh tag.

``` php
$modx->sendRedirect('https://modx.com',array('type' => 'REDIRECT_META'));
```

Send a 301 Moved Permanently response code instead of the default 302 Moved Temporarily response code.

``` php
$modx->sendRedirect('https://modx.com',array('responseCode' => 'HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently'));
```
